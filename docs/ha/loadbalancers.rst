AcuGIS Offers two types of Load Balancers: Local and Geographic

.. Note::
	Load Balancers can be added and resized at any time

Local Load Balancers point to servers in the same Data Center.


Geographic

Geographic Load Balancers point to servers in different Data Centers and direct traffic to those servers based on proximity to user location.
